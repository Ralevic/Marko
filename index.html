        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <section>
            <article>
               <p> Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (About this soundlisten);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) 
                was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.
                 In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the 
                 last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by 
                 bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was 
                 not commercially successful,
                 and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty.</p>

                 <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful.
                      As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London.
                       He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium.
                        He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. 
                        His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. 
                        His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. 
                        In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin,
                         who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes.
                          His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. 
                          During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.</p>

                <p>Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health,
                     did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage,
                      he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy.
                       After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet.
                        His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver.
                        [6] He died from his injuries two days later.</p>
                <p>Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide,
                     and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist "where discourses on madness and creativity converge".
                     [7] His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists.
                      He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter,
                       whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. 
                       Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold at auction,
                        and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's 
                        largest collection of his paintings and drawings.</p>

        <h2>Letters</h2>
        <section>
            <article>
               <p> The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, 
                   Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, 
                   are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890.[8] Theo van Gogh was an art 
                   dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people 
                   on the contemporary art scene.[9]</p>

                 <p>Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him;[11] Vincent kept few of the letters he received. 
                     After both had died, Theo's widow Johanna arranged for the publication of some of their letters. 
                     A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.
                     [12][13] Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a "diary-like intimacy"
                     ,[9] and read in parts like autobiography.[9] The translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a 
                     "fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually 
                     no other painter".[14]</p>

                <p>There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister Wil, 
                    58 to the painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard as well as individual letters to Paul Signac, 
                    Paul Gauguin and the critic Albert Aurier. Some are illustrated with sketches.[9] Many are undated, 
                    but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, 
                    mainly with those posted from Arles. While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English.[15] 
                    There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.[16]</p>

                <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 into a Dutch Reformed family in Groot-Zundert,
                 in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.[17] He was the oldest 
                 surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. 
                 Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.
                 [note 2] Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), 
                 who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. 
                 This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).</p>
